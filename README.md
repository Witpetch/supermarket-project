# Overview
In this project, we'll set up an efficient data processing pipeline. Starting with the creation of a new S3 bucket and uploading a remote CSV file, we'll establish a Data Catalog using a Crawler. Subsequently, a Glue ETL Job, driven by a Spark script, will handle data transformations. The refined data will be stored as a parquet file in S3, accompanied by a Data Catalog. Data querying will be conducted through Athena and S3 Select. The project culminates in the creation of a dashboard using Amazon QuickSight. As part of our production pipeline, we anticipate periodic modifications to the CSV file in S3, while maintaining a consistent schema. Our goal is to generate corresponding modified parquet files in a separate directory to uphold the integrity of the pipeline.
